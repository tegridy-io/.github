# Your local datacenter with tegridy ðŸ’—

For decades, weâ€™ve served the bulk of our internet services through large datacenters â€” a system dominated by big companies offering the same services, collecting our data and selling it to unscrupulous advertisers.
This system is not built to last, because it degrades the trust of its users, that it depends on.
But a growing number of innovative engineers are taking a different path, moving toward a cloud system that is more sustainable â€” environmentally, economically, and socially.
This system has room for datacenters of all sizes, producing a diverse range of services adapted to local conditions and regional markets.
Thats what we do at tegridy.io, local internet services for local people.
